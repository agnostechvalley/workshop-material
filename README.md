# List of all slide decks

This is a quick list of the workshop slide decks contained in this repo. These are slides formatted to be used with the [Go present tool](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present), which can be run locally. See the section at the bottom for more details.

## Using the Go present tool

#### Note: we strongly recommend that you run the slides locally on your machine. It is very easy and it won't fail due to network failures. Also, currently the online tool [doesn't allow force refreshes](https://github.com/golang/gddo/issues/281), so updated content will take a few hours to be shown.

- With Go installed, simply go to the root of this project and type ```present```.

- It will output a URL that you can past in your browser. The page at that address will list all the slides in this project. Click on the one of interest.

Note: edits you make to a slide will immediately be reflected on the page upon a reload.

For information on how to use elements of the present tool, see: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present
